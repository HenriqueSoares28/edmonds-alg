This package depends on the Boost libraries version 1.34 or later
(http://www.boost.org)

The algorithm is implemented in a single templated C++ function, and
therefore does not require building of any libraries. The function is
implemented in two header files:

src/edmonds_optimum_branching.hpp
src/edmonds_optimum_branching_impl.hpp

Copy these files to a suitable location where your compiler will look
for header files, or alternatively, copy these files to your source
directory. To use the function, simply include the header
"edmonds_optimum_branching.hpp". Documentation on how to use the
function is available in the header file itself. Note that the
function is built on top of the Boost Graph Library (BGL)
concepts. For information see the documentation of the BGL at
http://www.boost.org.

There is some documentation available describing Edmonds's algorithm,
along with some test programs and scripts. This package uses Scons
(http://www.scons.org) as build tool. To build the documentation and
run the tests, run the following commands in the root directory of the
package:

scons
scons test

If the required boost libraries are installed in a non-standard
location, use the following commands instead:

scons boost=/path/to/boost/installation/root
scons boost=/path/to/boost/installation/root test
