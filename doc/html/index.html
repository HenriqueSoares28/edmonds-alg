<H1>Edmonds's Algorithm</H1>

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<p>
The package <em>edmonds-alg</em> contains a C++-implementation of
Edmonds's optimum branching algorithm as described by Tarjan in
1977. The code is licensed under the opensource

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">
MIT license.
</a>

</p>


<p>
A branching in a directed graph is defined as a set of directed edges
that contain no cycles and such that no two edges are directed towards
the same vertex. Note that this is equivalent to a forest of rooted
trees. Given weights on the edges of a directed graph, we define a
maximum branching as a branching such that the sum of the weights of
its edges is maximal. Since finding a maximum branching is equivalent
to finding a minimum branching, we often speak of optimum branchings
instead.
</p>


<p>
In 1967, Edmonds gave an 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds's_algorithm">
algorithm
</a>

for finding an optimum branching in a directed graph (others
discovered similar algorithms independantly at approximately the same
time). In 1977, Tarjan gave the first description of an efficient
implementation of Edmonds's algorithm.
</p>


<H2>2. Requirements</H2>

<p>
In order to maximize code reuse, the implementation is built on top of
concepts in the

<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/graph/doc/index.html">
Boost Graph Library.
</a>

The package also uses some other parts of Boost, most notably,

<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/foreach.html">
Boost&nbsp;foreach
</a>

which was first introduced in Boost version 1.34. Therefore, Boost
version 1.34 or later is required for use of this package.
</p>



<p>
<a href="http://www.scons.org">
Scons
</a>

is used as a build tool to build the accompanying documentation
and test programs. Also, test scripts are written in

<a href="http://www.python.org">
Python
</a>
.
</p>


<H2>3. Installation</H2>

<p>
First, download the source from the

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/edmonds-alg">
Sourceforge&nbsp;project&nbsp;page
</a>.

The algorithm is implemented as a single template function in C++, and
as such, no libraries or executables need to be built. To use the
function, just copy the files 

<PRE>
src/edmonds_optimum_branching.hpp
src/edmonds_optimum_branching_impl.hpp 
</PRE>

to suitable locations where your compiler looks for header
files. Under Linux, a good place is usually /urs/include. You can also
just copy the two header files directly to the source directory of
your program. Any source file from which a call is made should include
the header edmonds_optimum_branching.hpp.
</p>



<p>
If you want to build the accompanying documentation and test programs,
you need to have Scons and Python installed (see Requirements
above). To build and test on Linux, run the following commands from
the root of the source directory:

<PRE> 
scons 
scons test 
</PRE>

Or if the boost library is in a non-standard location, use the
following commands instead:

<PRE>
scons boost=/path/to/boost/installation/root
scons boost=/path/to/boost/installation/root test
</PRE>
</p>


<p>
Information on how to use the algorithm, see the file
edmonds_optimum_branching.hpp. Also, a good example of usage can be
found in the test program test/test.cpp. In the future, more examples
may be provided (feedback from users may speed up this process).
